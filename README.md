# Md-Functions
 I have created this respiratory to create some functions that will reduce code for python users. for example if we want to take integer input from user and we also want error handling so in this case our function can be used with a single line of code. eg. takeinput(typeofinput,text,excepttext). Sorry for Grammer mistakes in my English!
